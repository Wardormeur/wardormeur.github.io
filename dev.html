	      As a CTO, my focus was spread between numerous topics - handling recruitment, designing the strategy to come for the company or finding the right contacts to train or recruit our team.
	      This lead us to rethink our data system and CRM to empower individual teams, pass a security audit, design a content recommendation system from scratch based off Elasticsearch, democratize the usage of automatization tooling via n8n and its usage of AI, or direct the redesign of our questionnaire builder - all of which are core to the company's strategy.

              My responsibilities as a product engineer were end to end. I had to own our projects from the
              technical design to their planning and maintenance, up to implementing success metrics.
              This large breadth of ownership into a platform group lead me into multi-team projects, working with
              varied roles and technologies in order to constantly have the most impactful results.
